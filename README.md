## About

Universal discord bot to suite all of your needs.

Want to use Ice? Invite link can be found on ice's [website](http://iceproductions.dev).

## Setting up

The setup is quite simple:

* Grab latest release and extract the contents somewhere on the disk
* Install dependencies (See [#dependencies](#dependencies))
* Aquire token (from [discord developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers)) and save it in config.json as token
* Create `managers/mysql.js` that exports pool (see [wiki](https://github.com/danbulant/ice-bot/wiki/Setting-up-database))
* Create MySQL databse with correct tables. (See [wiki](https://github.com/danbulant/ice-bot/wiki/Setting-up-database))
* Start the bot (with `node .`)

Then optionaly if you want to have link checking, add `virustotal` field into config.json containing VirusTotal api key.

## Dependencies

* Node (Tested with v12 & v13. Running on another version? Let us know!)
* NPM (bundled with Node on modern releases)
* Deno - Use as new version as possible. Needs to be installed by same user as the one running bot.
* *(optional)* Git (or even better, hub) for simple updates - run one command and your bot is up to date

Those are installed with `npm i` automatically.
